subtitle: "P118 rest-db-links - access Oracle Databases in the Cloud using ORDS, REST & JSON by Robert Marz"
lang: en
description: 'This talk covers a real-world solution, that recreates database links using ORDS, REST and JSON. It breaks the limits of database links by loosely coupling two databases. The complexity is completely hidden from users and developers.  Modern technologies such as REST and JSON offer elegant ways to couple databases without fixed dependencies. The protocol http(s) is able to surmount the corporate firewall and query databases in the cloud.  A transparent layer made of table functions, views and instead-of-triggers can be placed over the connection.  This talk introduces REST, JSON and ORDS very briefly. After the stage is set, we explore how to query auto-rest enabled tables from PL/SQL an process the JSON-documents. Finally, a view with an instead-of-trigger is built that can be used by the application developers.   A generator that produces all necessary objects will be shown. The generator can be integrated into SQLDeveloper.   The presentation includes a live demo.'
