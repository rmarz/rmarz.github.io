subtitle: "Automate Database Deployments With SQLcl"
description: 'SQLcl offers many ways to simplify your DevOps life. Imagine writing automation scripts for your database in languages like JavaScript, Python, or Perl-to name just a few-without the hassle of driver libraries. Although SQLcl is almost 100% compatible with SQL*Plus, it adds a lot of new commands and features, such as native support for Liquibase and Hashicorps Vault. The most potent new keyword is “script.” Script embeds the execution of SQL-statements or SQL*Plus-commands from your favorite scripting language. Extend SQLcl by writing functions, use your preferred language objects and control structures, and parallelize multiple tasks. This session includes live demos to showcase real-life solutions.'
