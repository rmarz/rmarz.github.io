subtitle: "Automatically deploy schema changes with Ansible and Liquibase"
lang: en
description: 'Database schemas and application code are tightly coupled together, but theyâ€™re often maintained and deployed separately.  The open-source project Liquibase helps you manage your schema changes by writing simple JSON or YAML documents. Liquibase makes it easy to deploy to different flavors of databases, rolling changes backward and forward as necessary.  Ansible is an open-source automation tool that enables you to define and run tasks on a set of remote targets. Like Liquibase changelogs, Ansible playbooks are JSON or YAML documents.  Utilizing the two tools together enables you to effectively version control your database schema changes and deploy them to multiple hosts simultaneously.  Agile and DevOps work hand in hand.  This talk introduces Liquibase and Ansible while demonstrating how to use them together.  All sources and examples will be available for download.  This presentation includes live demos.'
