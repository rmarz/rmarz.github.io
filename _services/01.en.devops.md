DevOps Tools are my friends.

Automation is my hobby.

I have implemented CI/CD pipelines in many different flavors:  In the Cloud. And on-premises.
But DevOps is much more than that - it changes the way we work together.  A successful merger of the development and operations departments to DevOps always involves a cultural change.

I have worked on both sides for years: Dev and Ops.
Benefit from my experience.
