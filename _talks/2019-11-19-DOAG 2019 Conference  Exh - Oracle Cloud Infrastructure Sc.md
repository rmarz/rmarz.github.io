subtitle: "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Scripting with Command-Line Interface for DBAs"
description: 'Setting up cloud environments using the web UI is only the second-best option. The method of choice is scripting. HashiCorpsâ€™ Terraform has become the lingua franca for defining large setups, but it appears to be a bit unwieldy for small changes. Oracle provides the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure command-line interface as open source on GitHub, which is ideal for those small changes. This session introduces you to scripting with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure command-line interface. It walks through the process of setting it up. A quick orientation is followed by a deep dive into the command-line and JSON parameters. The presentation concludes with tips and tricks as well as common caveats and how to avoid them. The presentation contains a live demo. All Demos are available for download.'
