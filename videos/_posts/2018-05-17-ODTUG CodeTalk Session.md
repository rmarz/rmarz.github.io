This talk covers a real-world solution that recreates database links using ORDS, REST, and JSON. It breaks the limits of database links by loosely coupling two databases. The complexity is completely hidden from users and developers. Modern technologies such as REST and JSON offer elegant ways to couple databases without fixed dependencies. The protocol http(s) is able to surmount the corporate firewall and query databases in the cloud. A transparent layer made of table functions, views, and instead-of triggers can be placed over the connection. 

This talk introduces REST, JSON, and ORDS very briefly. After the stage is set, we explore how to query auto-rest enabled tables from PL/SQL and process the JSON documents. Finally a view with an instead-of trigger is built that can be used by the application developers. A generator that produces all necessary objects will be shown. The generator can integrate into SQL Developer. 

The presentation includes detaild live demos.
