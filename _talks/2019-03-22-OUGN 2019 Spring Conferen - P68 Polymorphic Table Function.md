subtitle: "P68 Polymorphic Table Functions and Qualified Expressions by Robert Marz"
description: 'The most interesting new feature, Oracle 18c introduces to Developers, are Polymorphic Table Functions and Qualified Expressions.   Polymorphic Table Functions finally allow the Developer to define the structure of the returned records at runtime.   Qualified Expressions allows defining array- or record constructors that assign all values in a single statement.  What looks at first sight as syntactical sugar is a mighty tool - especially in conjunction with Polymorphic Table Functions.   This talk introduces the concepts of Polymorphic Table Functions and Qualified Expressions and demonstrates real-world use cases and scenarios.'
