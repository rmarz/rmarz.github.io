SQLcl is ready to replace the reliable but somewhat outdated SQL*Plus as the new command line interface of the database. 
The most exciting new feature of SQLcl is scripting: Batch scripts can now be written in languages such as JavaScript, Python, or Perl. 

This means a veritable cornucopia of options, many of which are not obvious at first sight. 

After a brief introduction to SQLcl, we will show many real-world examples that demonstrate the new possibilities. 

All examples are available for download to allow for further tests and exploration. 

This presentation provides many in-depth live demos.
