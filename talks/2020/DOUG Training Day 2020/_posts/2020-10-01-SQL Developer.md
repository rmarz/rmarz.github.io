description: 'There are so many helpful features in SQL Developer â€“ collect them all! When I presented at ACEs@home in June, I had to skip a lot of timesavers. Now is the time to show you more about my favourite developer IDE. For a scatterbrained and lazy person like me, SQL Dev offers a lot of support. For instance, Iâ€™ll show you how to name, arrange, save things and retrieve things Iâ€™ve done in the past. Also, how to move things (properties, reports, snippets etc.) to a different environment and how to easily add some missing functionality (yes, even this great tool is not perfect yet ðŸ˜‰

Robert Marz will also be co-presenting with Sabine on this topic.  His bio is at https://doug.org/speaker/robert-marz/

BTW: The @home presentation (Posted on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZdAYct-qvI&feature=youtu.be) is not a prerequisite for this talk. You can use all the tips from this session straight away.'
