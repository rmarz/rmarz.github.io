subtitle: "Automatically deploy schema changes with Ansible and Liquibase"
lang: en
description: 'Database schemas and application code are tightly coupled together, but often maintained and deployed separately. The opensource project Liquibase helps you manage your schema changes by writing simple JSON or YAML documents. Liquibase makes it easy to deploy to different flavors of databases and roll changes back and forward. Ansible is an opensource automation tool, that enables you to define and run tasks on a set of remote targets. Like Liquibase changelogs, Ansible playbooks are JSON or YAML documents. Both two tools together enable you to effectively version control your database schema changes and deploy them to multiple hosts at the same time. Agile and DevOps working hand in hand. This talk introduces Liquibase and ansible and demonstrates how to use them together. My session will follow this agenda: • Introduction to Liquibase. • Ansible - a short overview • YAML & JSON: two related file formats • Define changes in Liquibase • Deploy changes with Ansible • Caveats and workarounds All sources and examples will be available for download. This presentation includes live demos.'
