description: 'SQLcl offers many ways to simplify your DevOps life. Imagine writing automation scripts for your database in languages like JavaScript, Python or Perl, to name just a few, without the hassle of driver libraries. Although SQLcl is almost 100% compatible with SQL*Plus, it adds a lot of new commands and features to the old lady. The most potent new keyword is "script." Script embeds the execution of SQL-statements or SQL*Plus-commands from your favorite scripting language. Extend SQLcl by writing functions, use your favorite languageâ€™s objects and control structures and parallelize multiple tasks.  Within this truly interactive and entertaining session, the two presenting experts water your mouth and generate countless wants while demonstrating lots of real-life solutions to you. The presentation includes impressive live demos. All scripts and examples are available for download so that you can start developing your automation process immediately.'
